#### Install using a BASH script! 

[![Install VIP Shell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-VIP%20Shell-brightgreen)](#)


To install Vip shell, simply run the installer script available [here](https://github.com/NymexData/C-VipNX/raw/main/installer.sh).

Or just Copy - Paste in your terminal and use -curl- to start downloading the installer:

   ```
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NymexData/C-VipNX/master/installer.sh
   ```

If you want to use -wget- just copy/paste this line:

   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NymexData/C-VipNX/master/installer.sh
   ```

   On macOS to download - wget - just install it with Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install wget
   ```

#### Important note when installing:

If you encounter issues executing the file in the terminal, like this message "-bash: ./installer.sh: Permission denied", follow these simple steps to fix it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the installer script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to grant execute permission to the installer script:

   ```
   chmod +x installer.sh
   ```
   
4. Now you can run the installer without any problems.

   ```
   ./installer.sh
   ```
   NOTE: The script will ask for -sudo permissions-. Just simply type in macOS your macOS user password, and in Linux your -sudo- password.

Now type 'vipshell' in the terminal and enjoy using Vip shell! üòäüöÄ
